## installation and instructions followed as here:

# https://github.com/biota/sourcetracker2

# where the command used was the same as last example listed in Usage Example of above page

# exact command (where my input file called 'WP3ALL.biom.txt' and folder for output data called 'DNAout'
sourcetracker2 -i WP3ALL.biom.txt -m map.txt -o DNAout/ --jobs 25 --per_sink_feature_assignments

# this created a folder within 'DNAout' called 'FeatureTables' which contains one text file per sample
# analysed (ie per sink sample identified in metadata file)

# here is a script for combining all these text files into one df in R
# and using the file name (ie sample name) as a way to label them

## ==== combining the Feature tables output from SourceTracker2 ===

# identify my files
myFiles = list.files(path="~/Google Drive/Personal/WP3 paper workings/sourcetracker2-master/DNAout/FeatureTables/", pattern="*.txt")

# use lapply to read them each in using read.table()
data <- lapply(myFiles, read.table, sep="\t", header=TRUE)
# specify the sample names from the files names where I want to get out
# everything before the end part of the file name which is '.feature_table.txt'
names(data) <- gsub("\\.feature_table.txt$", "", myFiles)

# now use do.call with rbind to put them all together
# and the names defined in line 16 will become the rownames
combined.data <- do.call(rbind, data)
# can use the row names to create a variable called 'sample' which says which text file
# each row of data came from and therefore in my case which sample it came from
combined.data$Sample <- row.names(combined.data)
# im gonna reorder it to put this column at beginning of df as by default its at end
combined.data = combined.data[,c(1707,1:1706)]
# last thing, coz R wanted to make unique row names during rbind it appended .1 .2 and .3
# to my row names as there are three rows per sample
# I'll now remove -2 characters from all entires of this variable
combined.data$Sample = substr(combined.data$Sample,1,nchar(combined.data$Sample)-2)
# and just for niceness - rename second column as 'source' for grouping later
colnames(combined.data)[2] <- "Source"

# write it out
write.csv(combined.data, 'DNAfeatureTablesCombined.csv', row.names=F)

## can also use dplyr to do a total over all files, of proportions from each sink

library(dplyr)
# first sample names (var 1) as gonna group by source and do col sums
# on each OTU/ column
combined.data.slim = combined.data[,-1]
# now use dplyr to group by source and then do colsums
summy = combined.data.slim %>%
  group_by(Source) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(sum))

# easier to see transposed
rownames(summy)<-summy$Source
summyt = t(summy)
colnames(summyt) <- summyt[1,]
summyt = summyt[-1,]

# write this out too
write.csv(summyt, "OTUcountsPerSource-DNA.csv", row.names=F)

# this can probably be used to get an idea of which source certain OTUs came from
# for example my two sinks were very different so I used R to find OTUs which were 
# 0 in one sink and > x (eg 100) in the other.
